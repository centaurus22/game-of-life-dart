# game-of-life-dart

My goal is to create an extended version of Conway's Game of Live in the Dart programming language as a demo project. Currently the entities are already created.

## Goals
* Learn Dart :)
* Implement the project in the clean coding architecture.
* Using Unicode symbols to draw nice boxes for the simulation grid and display of key bindings.
* Provide multiple zoom levels for the simulation.
* Add a pretty rainbow colored background.
